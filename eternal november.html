		<h2>Usenet</h2>
		<p>
			<strong>Usenet</strong> is an early Internet social-network with origins in the 1980s.
		</p>
		<p>
			(<strong>Usenet</strong> was actually a copy of parts of an even earlier online social-network on a pre-Internet online system called <strong>BBS</strong>.)
		</p>
		<p>
			In 1993 <strong>Usenet</strong> experienced what some called — <strong>Eternal September</strong>.

		<p>
			What was Eternal-September‽ —

		<h2>Eternal September</h2>

			<strong>Usenet</strong>'s <strong>Eternal September</strong> was when — in 1993 a overwhelming number of new users joined <strong>Usenet</strong> within a relatively short period of time and —
		</p>
		<p>
			These newcomers to <strong>Usenet</strong> changed the social-norms — they changed the culture of <strong>Usenet</strong> against the will of many (maybe most) earlier users of <strong>Usenet</strong>.
		</p>
		<p>
			While many early <strong>Usenet</strong> users were welcoming to the newcomers — there was social conflict.

			They battled —

		<p>
			The people of Usenet's <strong>Eternal September</strong> — the overwhelming number of new users who joined <strong>Usenet</strong> — battled with the earlier users of <strong>Usenet</strong> —
		</p>
		<p>
			They battled about what the culture & social-norms of <strong>Usenet</strong> would be going forward.
		</p>
		<p>
			The early users of <strong>Usenet</strong> lost the battle!!!
		</p>
		<p>
			The social-norms & culture of <strong>Usenet</strong> were permanently changed.

			I think something like this happened to the <strong>Fediverse</strong> and <ziba-link transform="lowercase">Mastodon</ziba-link> —

		<h2>Eternal November</h2>
		<p>
			Around November, 2022 an overwhelming number of new users have joined the <strong>Fediverse</strong and <ziba-link transform="lowercase">Mastodon</ziba-link> within a relatively short period of time — mostly as part of the <ziba-link transform="lowercase">Twitter migration</ziba-link>.
		</p>
		<p>
			The newcomes to the Fediverse & Mastodon have largely been welcomed by the earlier users of the Fediverse.
		</p>
		<p>
			But there is conflict —
		</p>
		<p>
			Some of the <ziba-link transform="lowercase">Twitter migration</ziba-link> newcomers are battling with earlier users of the <strong>Fediverse</strong> & <ziba-link transform="lowercase">Mastodon</ziba-link> over what the culture & social-norms will be going forward.
		</p>
		<p>
			I think some of the culture and social-norms of the Fediverse & Mastodon have already started to change, as a result of this.
		</p>
		<p>
			How far it will go — only time will tell.
			But —
		</p>
		<p>
			I think — just like <strong>Usenet</strong> had its <strong>Eternal September<strong> — for better or worse, the <strong>Fediverse</strong> and <ziba-link transform="lowercase">Mastodon</ziba-link> are having their own <strong>Eternal November</strong>.
