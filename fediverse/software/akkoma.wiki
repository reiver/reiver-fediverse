§ Akkoma (Fediverse Software)

⸺ by Charles Iliya Krempeaux

**Akkoma** is [[fediverse/software]] focused on **micro-blogging**, that started its life as a fork of [[fediverse/software/pleroma]].

Being software for a micro-blogging social-media network, **Akkoma** is similar to:

• [[fediverse/software/firefish]],
• [[fediverse/software/friendica]],
• [[fediverse/software/gnu-social]],
• [[fediverse/software/gotosocial]],
• [[fediverse/software/mastodon]],
• [[fediverse/software/misskey]],
• [[fediverse/software/pleroma]],
• and others.

§§ Name

Akkoma's name is an homage to a character from the anime **Little Witch Academia** — **Atsuko Kagari**.

**Atsuko Kagari**'s nickname is **Akko**.
Thus the name ‘**Akkoma**’.

The Akkoma logo even includes a witch's hat — again, a reference to **Atsuko Kagari** a.k.a. **Akko**.

The tag-line for Akkoma is also:

― Magically expressive social media

Which again is a reference to **Atsuko Kagari** a.k.a. **Akko**.
