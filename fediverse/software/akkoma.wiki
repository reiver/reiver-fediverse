§ Akkoma (Fediverse)

by Charles Iliya Krempeaux

**Akkoma** is **Fediverse** software focused on **micro-blogging**, that started its life as a fork of [[pleroma]]

Being software for a micro-blogging social-media network, **Akkoma** is similar to:

• [[firefish]],
• [[friendica]],
• [[gnu-social]],
• [[gotosocial]],
• [[mastodon]],
• [[misskey]],
• [[pleroma]],
• and others.

§§ Name

Akkoma's name is an homage to a character from the anime **Little Witch Academia** — **Atsuko Kagari**.

**Atsuko Kagari**'s nickname is **Akko**.
Thus the name ‘**Akkoma**’.

The Akkoma logo even includes a witch's hat — again, a reference to **Atsuko Kagari** a.k.a. **Akko**.

The tag-line for Akkoma is also:

― Magically expressive social media

Which again is a reference to **Atsuko Kagari** a.k.a. **Akko**.
